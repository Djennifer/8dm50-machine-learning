For the reading assignment, you first have to select a recent journal publication
that describes an application of a machine learning method to a Medical Image Analysis or Computational Biology. Then, you have to write a 800 word review of the paper.

# Paper selection
You are free to select the paper that you will review in consultation with the course instructors and teaching assistants. The selected paper has to be recently published (after 2015) in a high-quality journal. And, of course, it has to be on a topic that you find interesting and want to learn more about.

Here is a non-extensive list of journals that you can use as a reference
(note that some journals are multidisciplinary):
Medical Image Analysis
IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging
IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering
IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
Computer Vision and Image Understanding
Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics
Magnetic Resonance in Medicine
Neuroimage
Radiology: Artificial Intelligence
Bioinformatics
PloS Computational Biology
Molecular Systems Biology
Cell Systems
Cancer Research
Nature Biotechnology
Frontiers in Oncology
Frontiers in Immunoloty
Cell Reports

Some specialised publications also publish Medical Image Analysis or Computational Biology research.
For example, the Modern Pathology journal often publishes papers on image analysis for histopathology. You can also find such
papers in interdisciplinary/wides scope journals such as Nature Methods, Nature Communications, Nature Medicine, Scientific Reports, PlosONE etc.

An example paper on the use of machine learning in Computational Biology:
Ali, M., Khan, S. A., Wennerberg, K., & Aittokallio, T. (2017). Global proteomics profiling improves drug sensitivity prediction: results from a multi-omics, pan-cancer modeling approach. Bioinformatics, (November 2017), 1â€“10.

An example paper on the use of machine learning in Medical Imaging:
Campanella, G., Hanna, M. G., Geneslaw, L., Miraflor, A., Silva, V. W. K., Busam, K. J., ... & Fuchs, T. J. (2019). Clinical-grade computational pathology using weakly supervised deep learning on whole slide images. Nature Medicine, 25(8), 1301-1309.

# Paper review

Once you have selected the paper, you have to write a short 800 word review that:
* Gives a summary of the application domain of the papers
* Gives a summary of the used methodology and evaluation metrics
* Discusses the strong and weak points of the methodology and evaluation metrics
* Suggests alternative methodology, evaluation metrics and ideas for improvement
