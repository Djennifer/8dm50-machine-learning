For the reading assignment, you first have to select a recent journal publication
that describes an application of a machine learning method to a medical imaging or
computational biology problem. Then, you have to write a 600 word review of the paper.

# Paper selection

Here is a non-extensive list of journals that you can use as a reference
(note that some journals are multidisciplinary):
Medical Image Analysis
IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging
IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering
IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
Computer Vision and Image Understanding
Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics
Magnetic Resonance in Medicine
Neuroimage
Radiology: Artificial Intelligence
Bioinformatics
PloS Computational Biology
Molecular Systems Biology
Cell Systems
Cancer Research
Nature Biotechnology
Frontiers in Oncology
Frontiers in Immunoloty
Cell Reports

Some specialised publications also publish Medical Image Analysis or Computational Biology research.
For example, the Modern Pathology journal often publishes papers on image analysis for histopathology. You can also find such
papers in interdisciplinary journals such as Nature Methods, Nature Communications, Nature Medicine, Scientific Reports, PlosONE etc.


An example paper on the use of machine learning in Computational Biology:
Ali, M., Khan, S. A., Wennerberg, K., & Aittokallio, T. (2017). Global proteomics profiling improves drug sensitivity prediction: results from a multi-omics, pan-cancer modeling approach. Bioinformatics, (November 2017), 1â€“10.

An example paper on the use of machine learning in Medical Imaging:
Campanella, G., Hanna, M. G., Geneslaw, L., Miraflor, A., Silva, V. W. K., Busam, K. J., ... & Fuchs, T. J. (2019). Clinical-grade computational pathology using weakly supervised deep learning on whole slide images. Nature Medicine, 25(8), 1301-1309.
