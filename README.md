# Machine Learning in Medical Imaging and Biology (8DM50)
The course covers a number of machine learning methods and concepts, including state-of-the-art deep learning methods, with example applications in the medical imaging and computational biology domains.

## Hybrid schedule due to the coronavirus pandemic
The 2020 edition of the course will be given in a hybrid manner combining on-campus and on-line education. We have a limited capacity for around 30-35 students to attend the lectures on-campus. The lectures will also be streamed on-line via Microsoft Teams for the students that want to attend remotely.

The schedule is as follows:
* **Lectures**, *time*: Mondays 13.30 - 15.30, *location*: Atlas - 1.210 and on-line via Microsoft Teams (the link will be shared on Canvas)
* **Practical work**, *time*: Mondays 15.30 - 17.30, *location*: on-line via Microsoft Teams (the link will be shared on Canvas)



# Materials

## Books
The lectures are mainly based on the selected chapters from following two books that are freely available online:

* [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/), Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville
* [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/), Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman

Additional reading materials such as journal articles are listed within the lecture slides.

## Assignments and Lectures

**IMPORTANT**: All materials tagged with (*tentative*)  are not updated from the previous edition of the course and might change for this edition. However, any changes made will not be substantial and you can still use the materials to get an early peek at the content.

# Course information

## Learning objectives

After completing the course, the student will be able to:
* Recognise how machine learning methods can be used to solve problems in medical imaging and computational biology.
* Comprehend the basic principles of machine learning.
* Implement and use machine learning methods.
* Design experimental setups for training and evaluation of machine learning models.
* Analyze and critically evaluate the results of experiments with machine learning models.

## Assessment

The assessment will be performed in the following way:

* Work on the practical assignments: 25% of the final grade (each assignment has equal contribution);
* Reading assignment: 10% of the final grade;
* Final exam: 65% of the final grade.

Intermediate feedback will be provided as grades to the submitted assignments.

The grading of the assignments will be done per groups, however, it is possible that individual students get separate grade from the rest of the group (e.g. if they did not sufficiently participate in the work of the group).

## Instruction

The students will receive instruction in the following ways:

* Lectures;
* Guided practical sessions;
* Contact hours with the project instructors for questions, assistance and advice;
* Online discussion (in Canvas, see below).

Course instructors:
* Mitko Veta
* Federica Eduati

Teaching assistants:
* Suzanne Wetstein
* Oscar Lapuente Santana
* Yasmina Al Khalil


## Recommended preliminary knowledge

8DB00 Image acquisition and Processing, and 8DC00 Medical Image Analysis.

## Software

The practical assignments for this course will be done in Python. We recommend the Anaconda Python distribution.

## Canvas

The [course page in Canvas] will be used for submission of the assignments, scheduling of the lectures and contact hours and announcements. The students are highly encouraged to use the Discussion section in Canvas. All general questions (e.g. issues with setting up the programming environment, error messages etc., general methodology questions) should be posted in the Discussion section in Canvas and not asked during the contact hours.
